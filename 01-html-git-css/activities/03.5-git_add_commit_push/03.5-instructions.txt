Instructions:
- Using GitHub (www.github.com) and the Command Line Interface (in terminal/git-bash), do the following:
- Create a new public GitHub repository on github.com, and name it whatever you like. Be sure to check the box for “initialize this repository with a README.”
- Next, clone the repo to your local directory using the command line interface (CLI).
- Then create an HTML file inside the local directory using the CLI.
- Add, Commit, and Push the code to GitHub (CLI again) then check it made it on github.com

Bonus:
- Find a partner in class and fork their repository to your own GitHub account. Clone this forked repository to your local directory.
- Add, Commit, and Push the code back to your forked copy.
- Finally, submit a pull request to send your changes to your partner’s repo.
